This is the nginx config that katstorm.party uses.

Works like most other KA proxies, except I've never seen another one that also proxies kastatic.com and torcache.net.
kastatic.com mostly hosts some KA .js/.css/image files, but torcache.net is where the actual .torrent file is hosted.

So if an ISP/country wants to kill KA and all KA proxies, all they would have to do is block torcache.net...
katstorm.party would still work though :-P

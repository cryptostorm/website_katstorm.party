# katstorm

Currently a placeholder, but this is where we'll publish any relevant materials used in providing the <a href="https://katstorm.party">katstorm.party</a> KickAssTorrents tracker proxy, provided by cryptostorm because that's how we roll.

Also we'll be publishing ssl certificate materials here, including a properly KeyChained alternative ssl cert that's cleaned of any CA-based cruft & associated security failures.

Stay tuned...
